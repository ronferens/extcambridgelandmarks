# Extended Cambridge Landmarks Dataset

 We introduce the Extended Cambridge Landmarks (ECL) dataset, which builds upon the foundation of the original [Cambridge Landmarks dataset](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/items/53788265-cb98-42ee-b85b-7a0cbc8eddb3). Our ECL dataset enhances the existing test scenes by incorporating diverse appearance conditions.
For each scene, we crafted three distinct flavors: *Evening*, *Winter*, and *Summer*.
 
As part of our commitment to the research community, we are excited to share both our data generation process and the refined code that underpins this valuableresource.


This data set was introduced in our work [Hypernetwork-Infused Camera Pose Localization and an Extended Cambridge Landmarks Dataset](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/hyperpose-0A22) for improving pose estimation accuracy in varying domains.

# Using the Data
* All extended scenes can be downloaded from this [link]().
* The <i>.csv</i> files in the <i>data</i> folder lists the test files generated in the ECL dataset.
* Each <i>.csv</i> file refers to a specific flavor ('evening', 'winter' and 'summer') of the Cambridge Landmarks Dataset.
